# ReviveRide: Modernizing Vintage Autos
### Project Overview
ReviveRide was developed as a capstone project for the Computer Engineering Technology program at Conestoga College. The goal of ReviveRide is to bring features found on modern vehicles to older vehicles. The project provides a dash camera, backup camera, head unit touchscreen with Android Auto, blind spot object detection, and remote start in an all-in-one, easy to install kit.

### Key Fob
The key fob wirelessly sends a signal to the control module telling it to start the car.

This repo contains the schematic and PCB for the key fob. The firmware for the key fob can be found here: https://github.com/BenMartens15/reviveride-key-fob-firmware
